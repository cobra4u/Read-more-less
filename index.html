<p>Machine Learning is, undoubtedly, one of the most exciting subsets of Artificial Intelligence.
     It completes the task of learning from data with specific inputs to the machine.
      It’s important to understand what makes Machine Learning work and, thus, how it can 
      be used in the future. 

     <span id="more">The Machine Learning process starts with inputting training data into the selected algorithm. 
        Training data being known or unknown data to develop the final Machine Learning algorithm.
         The type of training data input does impact the algorithm, and that concept will be covered 
         further momentarily. 
        
        New input data is fed into the machine learning algorithm to test whether the algorithm works 
        correctly. The prediction and results are then checked against each other.
        
        If the prediction and results don’t match, the algorithm is re-trained multiple times until 
        the data scientist gets the desired outcome. This enables the machine learning algorithm to 
        continually learn on its own and produce the optimal answer, gradually increasing in accuracy
         over time.
